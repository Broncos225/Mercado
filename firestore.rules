/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Mercado app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Only the authenticated user
 * can read or modify data under their respective `/users/{userId}` path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, including shopping lists and shopping list items.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Data validation is minimized for prototyping, focusing on ownership and relational integrity.
 * - The rules explicitly deny any write operations with `if false` unless a specific permission is granted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The path-based data structure `users/{userId}/shoppingLists/{shoppingListId}/items/{itemId}`
 * allows direct authorization checks using `request.auth.uid == userId` without requiring extra `get()` calls.
